## CoastWatch Training

CoastWatch distributes geospatial data (satellite and non-satellite data) and helps people access and use global and regional geospatial data for ocean and coastal applications.  
Our satellite data products and services can support research, resource management, and decision-making on topics such as understanding, managing and protecting ocean and coastal resources and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, weather, and climate.
